# expect_error: Type annotation required
# Test that ambiguous polymorphic calls require type annotations
# When a function's type signature implies params share a type variable,
# but the call site provides incompatible concrete types

# This function applies f to both x and y - they must have compatible types

    # Error: f takes 'a', so x and y must both be 'a'
    # But here x is Int and y is String - conflict
